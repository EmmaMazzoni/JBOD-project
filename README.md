# Networked JBOD Client Implementation | C, Linux
- Developed a client-side component to support JBOD operations over a network using a proprietary protocol.
- Integrated networking capabilities into an existing mdadm system by replacing local JBOD operations with network-based ones, improving system flexibility and resilience.
- Implemented functions for connecting to and disconnecting from JBOD servers and exchanging operation requests and responses over the network.

**This was a lab done in my systems programming class. The instruction file only contains what was implemented in the final part of the lab. I wrote a majority of the code.
